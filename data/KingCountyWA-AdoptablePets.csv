When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and spirited kitten. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

My name is Sienna and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on July 31, 2025 with my siblings.<p/><p/>I am a kitten who has had very little human interaction before arriving at RASKC so I am still learning to trust. I can be quite bolty and squirmy at first. I am looking for a patient family who understands I am a work in progress.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home. When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving kitten who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",

I will need a calm, quiet and patient home that is willing to help me re-learn how to be a happy pet dog. Someone who is willing to let me come to them in my own time would be a good match. I seem to enjoy walks and down time in a quiet environment, I may make a good office buddy for someone who works from home. <p/><p/>I have met other dogs while in the shelter and may benefit from an easy going but confident friend in my new home! <p/><p/>Due to my shyness, I am most likely to succeed in an adult only home a this time. <p/><p/>I am 44lbs and am considered a medium sized dog. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

MUCH TO HIS DISMAY, his siblings were all girls, so they got to go home with mama.  I was quickly fostered into a great human family with other bunnies.  Unfortunately, the bonded group and I just were not meant to be.  I am about just about 20 weeks as I returned to RASKC on 26 July, a few days after I got fixed.  Human family made sure I was comfortable post procedure in an environment I loved.  Current Location: King County Pet Adoption Center 21615 64TH AVE S KENT, WA 98032<p/><p/>I tried hard to bond to the other rabbits during foster time. I was always nice and licked the girls.  The existing buck rabbit did not take kindly to me joining ranks.<p/>I did have some wonderful times running and playing with a couple of rabbits at foster, and I was very gentle, unless I accidentally jumped on someone by mistake.  Still grasping the whole rabbit airborne maneuvers.  Humans love to watch, and I love to show them my new moves.<p/><p/>So, in short, I feel I will not have any trouble bonding with another rabbit friend with proper introductions. If you are considering adding a second bunny to your family, familiarize yourself with the rabbit bonding process and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like us to host a speed date to find the best match.<p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to fresh water!  I am still growing and get excited for human contact and dinner time salad especially.  I may be a little awkward/clumsy right now, but I do give my human friends another reason to smile.  After dinner salad time I love to run around, jump, do binkies, and get pettings.  Did I say, I like to have cuddle time with humans when I am ready?<p/><p/>As a young bunny, I like to help in the kitchen and get the salads ready for all bunnies.  I love to check different salad components for freshness and flavor.  One of my top skills in the foster family was helping consume salad.  Another top skill was taking naps on top of my hidey house preparing for hard work in the kitchen at dinner time.<p/><p/>When it was my time to run around and explore the house, I remembered to return to my litter box.  Sometimes I would excel at too much exercise and just crash anywhere.  Lucky the house was mostly carpeted, so when I when plump, it just felt good and relaxing.<p/>",

She is loving, but not needy.    She is very happy to chill at your side.  Fa She wants to please and is very trainable.   She gets along well with the older, larger dog in the foster home, liking to sleep right next to her.  She plays well with the other dog, and she is not hyper but has energy to go on nice long walks and to play as much as you want.    She is potty trained and crate trained, and she is also able to stay uncrated in the house without being destructive.    Clementine can be fearful and she really benefits from a calm approach and positive reinforcement.   She has been nervous when people come over and will bark a little, but she calms down and warms up very quickly to guests.    I think she would do well in a household with another dog, and would likely do well as an only dog, too.     <p/><p/>",

If you are considering adding a second bunny to your family, familiarize yourself with the rabbit bonding process and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like us to host a speed date to find the best match.  <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow. <p/><p/>",

She is friendly with other dogs, although smaller dogs may find her too rambunctious.  She does need a special diet for her allergies, and takes a daily medication.  She hopes to find a family who will buy her some fashionable pajamas and a nice raincoat - Rosie is a fair-weather girl!

My name is Juno and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on 4/13/25. I was out in foster care for a bit, and then I was adopted. However, I need someone around to rely on at all times, as I do not like being left alone. My caretaker understood the importance of what I needed, and also was respecting the opinions of the other animals in the home (I liked to chase the cat, and that was stressful for everyone) so, I was returned to the shelter to find my forever home.<p/><p/>Going forward, I would do best in a home without any other animals, and someone around all the time.<p/><p/>I weigh ~60 lbs and am considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>So far, at the shelter I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing! I came in with an uncomfortable skin infection so I sometimes pets make me nervous but I am quickly learning that they aren't so bad now that I am feeling better!<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs who are very gentle and easy-going. I would not do well with energetic dogs with a rowdy play style. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without young children. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>Your new pet received a basic physical exam, in addition to routine vaccines, deworming, and topical flea preventative, if indicated.  Although your new pet is ready for adoption, there is always a possibility of additional medical conditions that have not been detected or may develop in the future.  Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1) Dermatitis/pyoderma - Juno came in with significant dermatitis/pyoderma (skin infection) all over. We have started her on systemic/oral antibiotics. Please continue to monitor her skin. This may take some to heal and for fur to grow back. If her skin does not improve or gets worse, please follow up with your regular veterinarian or veterinary dermatologist. There is a possible underlying allergy component.<p/><p/>",

I could see him equally happy with an active family, couples, or a single owner. We didn’t observe him with other animals, but I suspect he would be fine.<p/><p/>Overall, he has not been shy with us, but rather surprisingly confident. He wanted to explore right away, and while he would come to “check” on us, he is definitely curious about his surroundings. He will startle a bit at unfamiliar sounds, but he is more curious than fearful..."" <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow.

He has great house manners and is very food-motivated, which helps with training. Although he is anxious around other dogs, he has made much progress since being in a calm home environment. If you can bring some patience, kindness, and treats, you will be rewarded with a loving companion for life.<p/> <p/>I am motivated by many things like toys, treats and people! I will happily ""sit"" and ""shake"" for all of them :)<p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality!

My name is Hopper and I'm a rabbit who is looking for a forever home. <p/><p/>I came in with Tod, we are a bonded pair and should be adopted together. <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow. <p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",

My name is Apricot and I'm a rabbit who is looking for a forever home. <p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on May 15, 2025 when I was found roaming in their pasture.<p/><p/>I came in alone but could potentially be bonded to a new rabbit friend with proper introductions. If you are considering adding a second bunny to your family, familiarize yourself with the rabbit bonding process and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like us to host a speed date to find the best match.  <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",

My name is Holister and I'm a rabbit who is looking for a forever home. <p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on May 27, 2025.<p/><p/>I came in with Aeropostale (A729211) we are a bonded pair and should be adopted together. <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",

I can be quite bolty and squirmy at first. I am looking for a patient family who understands I am a work in progress.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home. When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving kitten who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",
